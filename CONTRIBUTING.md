# How  to contribute
Contributions are always welcome!

## Contributing Code
If you would like to contribute code please fork this repository and issue a
pull request against the master branch. It is recommended that you make any
changes to your fork in a separate branch that you would then use for the pull
request. If you would like to receive credit for your contribution outside of
git, please add your name and email address (optional) to the CONTRIBUTORS.txt
file. All contributions should follow the
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding standard.

## Contributing Documentation
If you would like to contribute to the documentation, please feel free to update
this wiki. I request that you do not make changes to this home page but other
pages (including new ones) are fair game. Please leave a descriptive log message
for any changes that you make.
